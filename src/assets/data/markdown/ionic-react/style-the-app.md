# Lab: Style the Application

In this lab, you will further explore how to style your application.

**Note:** the first half of this lab is just explanation, so do not try to put the CSS samples anywhere. The second half will apply all of this to our app. If you want to skip all of the explanation, look for the section titled **Putting it All Together**.

## A Note on iOS and Material Design Styling

The Ionic Framework automatically adapts between styling that matches the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and Android's Material Design. We _highly_ suggest that you keep this paradigm in place. It allows your customers to see the application in a manner that makes sense to them on whatever platform they are on. The best practice with regard to this is to style your application in a way that injects your own branding without interfering with the native styling. This makes the application look "at home" on each platform.

## Styling

Our design team has come back to us with some requirements about how the application should look. Luckily these are fairly light weight suggestions for now, but we are going to want to start thinking about how we will accomplish what the design team requires.

### Scoped CSS vs. Global CSS

Generally, we want as much of our styling to be as global as possible in order to give our application an overall consistent look and feel. However, it is sometimes desirable to only apply a particular style within a specific view or component.

Have a look at the bottom of the `src/shared/Rating.css` file. There you will find the following styles:

```css
.rating ion-icon {
  font-size: 24px;
  padding-right: 12px;
  color: gold;
}

.rating ion-icon:last-child {
  padding-right: 0px;
}
```

Notice the `.rating` class in the selector. This effectively scopes the styling to the Rating component since it is the only one with the `rating` class. Without this, the CSS that we have here could apply to every single `ion-icon` within our application, and we do not want this. We want these particular styles to _only_ apply to `ion-icon`s that are a part of this component.

For most of our styling, we want a more global scope, but we would not put such styling in a component's CSS file like we did here. The reason is, that while it may actually apply globally it would be very difficult for developers to track and find. Rather, the best practice is to:

- scope local styles like was done for the rating
- place global styles in a global file (or another file imported by a global styling file)

Let's create a file `src/theme/global.css` and import it in `App.tsx`.

We will expand this shortly to contain more styles. As the styles grow, we will want to look at splitting them out into separate files that are imported here, but for now we can just add our styles to the `global.css` file.

### Shadow DOM

Most of the components in the Ionic Framework use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM" target="_blank">Shadow DOM</a>. This works very similar to the `scoped` discussion above (just without the extra classes), allowing the framework developers to apply styling to the individual components without having that styling bleed out into other components. This also allows you as a developer to use the component without having to worry about the details of the component's construction when styling your own application.

However, it also means that different techniques must be employed when styling these components. The authors of the components must provide you with a styling API that defines the ways in which they intend for you to be able to style these components. The two mechanisms that make this possible are `CSS Custom Properties` (also called `CSS Variables`) and `Shadow Parts`.

### Light DOM

There is no official term called "Light DOM" but it is a term that commonly refers to items outside of a shadow root that you can style via traditional means. Even for many components that use shadow DOM you are still able to apply "light DOM" styling to them. For example:

```css
ion-card {
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

The `ion-card` uses shadow DOM, but that is for the internal structure. The border radius applies to the card itself, which is visible in the normal DOM tree, and thus can be styled via traditional means.

### CSS Custom Properties

The Ionic Framework makes heavy use of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" target="_blank">CSS Custom Properties</a>. They are used to define the color scheme, default padding, etc. They are also used heavily in order to style individual components. Have a look at the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/button#css-custom-properties" target="_blank">CSS Custom Properties for a button</a> as an example. This defines an API for the ways in which the framework authors intend for you to be able to style a button. You can do so as such:

```css
ion-button {
  --opacity: 0.75;
}
```

This will apply a 75% opacity to all buttons in the application. You probably want to be a bit more restrictive with your selector, but that is the basic idea with the custom properties.

### Shadow Parts

A newer specification is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::part" target="_blank">Shadow Parts</a>. This allows the component author to tag specific parts of the component as something you can apply styles to as if it were in the light DOM. This allows component developers to still restrict how a component can be styled without having to redefine all of the ways an underlying element can be styled via a CSS Custom Property.

As a result, users of the component can still style the component in ways that they are used to styling things, while still being protected from the implementation details of how the component itself is rendered internally.

Have a look at the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/select#css-shadow-parts" target="_blank">Shadow Parts of a Select</a>. Notice that the various parts of a select are abstracted into parts that you can access and style, but you do not have to worry about the details of exactly how the component itself was constructed.

This allows you to style the icon, for example, as such:

```css
ion-select::part(icon) {
  width: 20px;
  border: 1px solid;
  border-radius: 4px;
}
```

## Putting it All Together

**Note:** now we are getting to the part where we will modify our code... ðŸ¤“

The design team has started giving us design requirements. Mostly the color schemes to use for both light and dark mode, but they would also like a minor tweak to the border radius on the cards and a slightly different style on the select dropdown.

Make sure you have a `theme/src/global.css` file created and imported in `App.tsx` if you have not done so already.

### The Color Theme

Our design team has decided on the following colors.

Light Mode Theme:

- Primary: `#ac9d83`
- Secondary: `#f1ebe1`
- Tertiary: `#ccc2b1`

Dark Mode Theme:

- Primary: `#ac9d83`
- Secondary: `#5f5037`
- Tertiary: `#8a7a5f`

#### Defining Colors

The color scheme for the application is defined in `src/theme/variables.css` via a set of CSS Custom Properties. Each color within the system has 6 settings. For example:

```css
--ion-color-primary: #ac9d83;
--ion-color-primary-rgb: 172, 157, 131;
--ion-color-primary-contrast: #000000;
--ion-color-primary-contrast-rgb: 0, 0, 0;
--ion-color-primary-shade: #978a73;
--ion-color-primary-tint: #b4a78f;
```

Given the base color (`#ac9d83` in this case), you can use our <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator" target="_blank">Color Generator</a> tool to generate a set of values for each color. Do this for the Light Mode theme colors and update `src/theme/variables.css`.

#### Handling Dark Mode

The framework can automatically adjust for dark mode on browsers that support it. Scroll down to the line that has `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` in it. The properties that are defined within there are for dark mode.

Notice that it has the same set of colors defined there, only with different values for use in dark mode. Use the <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator" target="_blank">Color Generator</a> and the Dark Mode theme colors above to determine the values that we should use here, and then update the file.

There is also a set of other colors for both iOS and Material Design. For these, our designers also provided us with some values, some of which were generated via a color gradient tool. Here are the values to use there:

```css
.ios body {
  --ion-background-color: #110b00;
  --ion-background-color-rgb: 17, 11, 0;

  --ion-text-color: #ffffff;
  --ion-text-color-rgb: 255, 255, 255;

  --ion-color-step-50: #1b1710;
  --ion-color-step-100: #24211a;
  --ion-color-step-150: #2e2a24;
  --ion-color-step-200: #39352e;
  --ion-color-step-250: #433f38;
  --ion-color-step-300: #434a43;
  --ion-color-step-350: #5a554d;
  --ion-color-step-400: #656059;
  --ion-color-step-450: #716c64;
  --ion-color-step-500: #737870;
  --ion-color-step-550: #89847c;
  --ion-color-step-600: #969088;
  --ion-color-step-650: #a29d94;
  --ion-color-step-700: #afa9a0;
  --ion-color-step-750: #bcb6ad;
  --ion-color-step-800: #c9c3ba;
  --ion-color-step-850: #d6d0c7;
  --ion-color-step-900: #e3ded4;
  --ion-color-step-950: #f1ebe1;

  --ion-toolbar-background: #1b1710;

  --ion-item-background: #110b00;

  --ion-card-background: #24211a;
}
```

```css
.md body {
  --ion-background-color: #110b00;
  --ion-background-color-rgb: 17, 11, 0;

  --ion-text-color: #ffffff;
  --ion-text-color-rgb: 255, 255, 255;

  --ion-border-color: #24211a;

  --ion-color-step-50: #1b1710;
  --ion-color-step-100: #24211a;
  --ion-color-step-150: #2e2a24;
  --ion-color-step-200: #39352e;
  --ion-color-step-250: #433f38;
  --ion-color-step-300: #434a43;
  --ion-color-step-350: #5a554d;
  --ion-color-step-400: #656059;
  --ion-color-step-450: #716c64;
  --ion-color-step-500: #737870;
  --ion-color-step-550: #89847c;
  --ion-color-step-600: #969088;
  --ion-color-step-650: #a29d94;
  --ion-color-step-700: #afa9a0;
  --ion-color-step-750: #bcb6ad;
  --ion-color-step-800: #c9c3ba;
  --ion-color-step-850: #d6d0c7;
  --ion-color-step-900: #e3ded4;
  --ion-color-step-950: #f1ebe1;

  --ion-toolbar-background: #1b1710;

  --ion-tab-bar-background: #1b1710;

  --ion-item-background: #110b00;

  --ion-card-background: #24211a;
}
```

#### Applying the Colors

The first requirement from our design team is that the pages should have a gradient background, going from from white to `--ion-color-secondary` for the light theme, or `--ion-background-color` to `--ion-color-secondary` for dark theme. We will do this via a class. Unless otherwise noted, all of the following style changes are being made in the `src/theme/global.css` file.

```css
.main-content {
  --background: linear-gradient(white, var(--ion-color-secondary));
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .main-content {
    --background: linear-gradient(var(--ion-background-color), var(--ion-color-secondary));
  }
}
```

Then add the `main-content` class to the `IonContent` elements in each of our pages like so: `<IonContent className="main-content">`.

So far so good, but the lists in a couple of our pages show the default background color, which looks a little out of place, so let's make the background for the various list elements transparent (in `src/theme/global.css`).

```css
.list-ios {
  background: transparent;
}

.list-md {
  background: transparent;
}

.item {
  --background: transparent;
}

ion-list-header {
  --background: transparent;
}
```

Nice!

We have a couple of other components where we need to set a specific color. Namely the tabs as well as the footer area on the login page. To modify the color of specific components, we can set the color attribute as such: `color="primary"`. Let's use this to set our colors:

**`src/login/LoginPage.tsx`**

```tsx
    <IonFooter>
      <IonToolbar color="secondary">
        <IonButton
```

**`src/Tabs.tsx`**

```tsx
    </IonRouterOutlet>
    <IonTabBar color="tertiary" slot="bottom">
      <IonTabButton tab="tea" href={`${url}/tea`}>
```

### Other Styles

First, our design team wants a slightly more obvious radius on our cards. Since this is in the light DOM we can use traditional styling techniques to accomplish this.

```css
ion-card {
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

## Conclusion

We have now applied styling across our application. Test it out in both light and dark mode. Next we will allow users to share tasting notes from the app!
