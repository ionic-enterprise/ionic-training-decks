# Lab: Generate the Application

In this lab, you will:

- Use the Ionic CLI to create a starter application
- Learn some Ionic CLI commands
- Build and run the starter application

## Overview

The Ionic command line (CLI) is the main tool used to develop Ionic Framework applications. This tool allows you to generate new applications, build applications, interact with Appflow, and many other tasks. The Ionic command line also wraps and extends several other command lines such as the Capacitor command line, the Vite command line, etc.

If you type `ionic --help` in the terminal, you will get a list of the available top level commands that can be run via the CLI. These commands are separated into two sections: Global Commands and Project Commands. Global Commands can be run from anywhere where as Project Commands can only be run within an Ionic project directory. Commonly used commands include `start`, `info`, `build`, and `serve`. We will learn more about these commands as we use them.

## Create the Application

The first thing we will use the Ionic CLI for is to start a new application. Type `ionic start --help` to get some instructions on how the `start` command works as well as some examples on how to use it. Notice that it has two basic modes of operation. You an either enter the command with a complete set of options, at which point the start operation will run all of the way through without asking questions, or you can supply a partial set of options, and the `start` command will prompt you for the information that it needs. If you just type `ionic start`, it will prompt for all of the information.

Lets start our application via whichever technique you want.

1. At the command line, change directories in to a starting directory. I use `~/Projects/Training`
2. Enter the following command: `ionic start tea-taster blank --type=react --no-git`
3. Alternatively, you could just enter `ionic start` and let the command line ask you for what it needs

**Example:**

```bash
$ cd ~/Projects/Training
$ ionic start tea-taster blank --type=react --no-git
```

Let's take a look at some of these options more closely:

- The third option is the name of the application.
- The forth option, `blank` tells Ionic to use the `blank` starter. We have three basic starters: `blank`, `tabs`, and `sidemenu`. The main difference is the style of navigation.
- The `--type` option specifies the type of application to create. Options include `angular`, `react`, `vue`, `ionic-angular`, and `ionic1`.
- The `--no-git` option tells the CLI not to create a git repo. We will create that ourselves.

Once the application has been generated, let's start the development server:

```bash
$ cd tea-taster
$ ionic serve
```

## Enforce Consistent Styling

<a href="https://prettier.io/" target="_blank">Prettier</a> is an excellent tool that you can use to keep the formatting of your code consistent and clean. We highly suggest you use a tool such as this. Whether you are a lone developer or part of a team, using a tool such as Prettier means that you do not have to think about the formatting of your code. Better yet, you do not run into "formatting wars" between developers.

Prettier itself is an opinionated code formatter, and Ionic has its own opinions on how it is best configured, so let's install both Prettier and Ionic's Prettier configuration. We will also install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky" target="_blank">husky</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-quick" target="_blank">pretty-quick</a>. This will allow us to set up a commit hook to make sure Prettier is run with each commit. After that we don't have to waste brain cycles thinking about code formatting ever again.

```bash
npm install -D @ionic/prettier-config husky prettier pretty-quick
```

Modify your `package.json` file. Move the `description` up to the top and giving it a reasonable value, add a `prepare` script that runs `husky install` to make sure the hooks are available, and then add the Prettier config portion to the bottom. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "tea-taster",
  "description": "Tea Tasting Notes",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "author": {
    "name": "Ionic",
    "url": "https://ionic.io"
  },
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "prepare": "husky install",
    ...
  },
  "dependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    ...
  },
  "prettier": "@ionic/prettier-config"
}
```

**Note:** Throughout the training portions of code examples will be snipped and replaced with `...` (ellipsis). This is done for brevity and to better focus on actionable areas.

Initialize git and Husky:

```bash
git init
npm install
```

The output of the `npm install` should look something like this:

```bash
$ npm install

> tea-taster@0.0.1 prepare
> husky install

husky - Git hooks installed

up to date, audited 1157 packages in 2s

163 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities
```

**Note:** we also could have run `npx husky install` but using `npm install` ensures that we have the `prepare` set up properly.

By default, the git hooks handled by `husky` are stored in the `.husky` directory. Let's add a couple now:

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npx pretty-quick --staged"
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm run lint"
```

This will ensure our code is properly formatted before each commit. It will also ensure that our code does not have any linting errors before we push it out to the `origin` repo. It would also be good to run the unit tests in the `pre-push` hook, but we have not gotten that far yet.

Finally, let's add all of our source to git and commit it.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

The output should look something like this:

```
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
üîç  Finding changed files since git revision null.
üéØ  Found 26 changed files.
‚úçÔ∏è  Fixing up .eslintrc.js.
‚úçÔ∏è  Fixing up .vscode/extensions.json.
‚úçÔ∏è  Fixing up cypress.config.ts.
...
‚úçÔ∏è  Fixing up vite.config.ts.
‚úÖ  Everything is awesome!

 create mode 100644 .browserslistrc
 create mode 100644 .eslintrc.js
 create mode 100644 .gitignore
 ...
```

Notice the "Fixing up" lines. That is the `pre-commit` hook we just set up making sure everything is formatted properly. At this point all of the source should be formatting properly and will remain so automatically with each commit.

## Update Dependencies

It is important to keep our dependencies up to date on a regular basis. At least once a quarter (though preferably more often than that), we should evaluate our dependencies, and update them to the latest supportable version. Before we do that, though, it is important to know a couple of important concepts: <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> (a.k.a. semver), and the `npm` <a href="https://semver.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">Version Range Syntax</a>.

### Semantic Versioning

<a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a> is, at a basic level, a three point versioning scheme as such: `major.minor.patch`. A modification of the version at any level signifies the types of changes made in the version:

- **Major**: breaking changes are contained in this release.
- **Minor**: new features have been added in this release, but in a backwards compatible manner.
- **Patch**: bug fixes and other optimization are in this release, all done in a backwards compatible manner.

Most libraries and tools that you will use follow semver (or at least try to).

### Version Range Syntax

NPM uses a <a href="https://semver.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">Version Range Syntax</a> to specify the acceptable versions for a package. This is a rather rich syntax and you can read about it in their documentation if you wish. Here we will examine the three most common forms used: pinned, patch-level, or minor.

- **pinned**: this syntax will _only_ take the specified version. Example: `1.2.3`.
- **patch-level**: this syntax uses the `~`. It will take patch level upgrades via `npm update`. Example: `~1.2.3`.
- **minor**: this syntax uses the `^`. It will take minor or patch level upgrades via `npm update`. Example: `^1.2.3`.

### The Update Process

To determine which packages are outdated and update them:

1. Create a new branch in case you need to back out your changes.
1. `npm outdated`: this will create a list of items that are out of date, along with the "Wanted" and "Latest" versions.
   1. **Wanted:** the latest version that matches the version range specification for the dependency.
   1. **Latest:** the latest version of the dependency, depending on its `@latest` tag.
1. Examine the changes for the out of date dependencies.
1. Use `npm update` to update dependencies to their "Wanted" version.
1. Use `npm install <dependency>@latest` to update dependencies to their "Latest" version.

Usually it is safe to `npm update` all dependencies that qualify.

Updating dependencies to the `@latest` version should generally be done with more care.

Perform a build and run all automated tests between individual updates.

Commit each individual update (you can always squash the commits before merging into `main`). This will allow you to fall back to a working state if any individual update causes problems.

Let's practice by updating our project now (**note**: you do not need to do all of the `git` related parts for the training, but you definitely should if you are working with a production project).

### Side Note: `ionic serve` vs. `npm run dev`

You may be used to using `npm run dev` to start an application. That works, but it is different. The application is for all intents and purposes a React application and was generated using Vite with the standard React TypeScript schematics with some extra Ionic spices, so all of the base Vite CLI application scrips are there.

In a nutshell:

- `npm run dev` uses the Vite CLI directly calling `vite`, which uses the first free port starting at 5173
- `ionic serve` also uses the Vite CLI, calling `vite`, however it uses the first free port starting at 8100

In either case, the Vite CLI does all the heavy lifting, so use whichever command you want to use.

## Conclusion

Congratulations on creating your `@ionic/react` application! Next we will explore unit tests and discuss how they can help us in our development life cycle.
