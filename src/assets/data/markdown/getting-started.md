# Getting Started

In order to follow along with creating the applications described here, you will need to perform the following actions on your development machine.

- Make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed on your machines

- Create a working directory for your project
   - I use `~/Projects/Training` on my Mac and Linux machines, but you can use whatever you want so long as you have access

- Run `npm -g ionic cordova` 
  - You may need to use `sudo` on Mac/Linux or right-click & **Run as Administrator** in Windows
  
- Follow one of the following guides to set up the rest of the build tools:
  - [Mac](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/platform-setup/mac-setup.html)
  - [Windows](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/platform-setup/windows-setup.html)
