# Getting Started

In order to follow along with creating the applications described here, you will need to perform the following actions on your development machine.

- Make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">Git</a> installed on your machines

- Create a working directory for your project

  - I use `~/Projects/Training` on my Mac and Linux machines, but you can use whatever you want so long as you have access

- Run `npm install -g @ionic/cli`

  - You may need to use `sudo` on Mac/Linux or right-click & **Run as Administrator** in Windows

- Follow one of the following guides to set up the rest of the build tools:
