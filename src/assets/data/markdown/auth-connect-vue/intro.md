# Training: Auth Connect / Ionic / Vue / Capacitor

This training demonstrates how to integrate Auth Connect within an Ionic Framework application that has been written using Vue and Capacitor. In the course of this training you will:

- Construct a simple Ionic application requiring authentication
- Use Auth Connect to authenticate via Azure AD B2C
- Create a simple authentication workflow
- Guard routes that require authentication
- Integrate Auth Connect with Identity Vault

It is assumed that before taking this training you have a general understanding of how to build a hybrid mobile application using the Ionic Framework with Vue and either Apache Cordova or Capacitor. This training uses Capacitor, but a deep understanding of Capacitor itself is not required.
