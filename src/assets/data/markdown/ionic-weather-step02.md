# Lab: Integrate Ionic Pro

The first task we will perform with our newly generated application is to integrate it with the Ionic Pro services. Ultimately, this will allow us to deploy changes to our devices.

In order to complete this lab, you will need the Ionic Pro APP ID for your application. This is obtained from the <a href="https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/apps" target="_blank">Ionic Pro Dashboard</a>.

To set up your application for use with Ionic Pro, you need to install the latest version of the Ionic Pro client, initialize the Ionic Pro Client in the `app.module.ts` file, and install the Ionic Pro plugin.

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

1. create a feature branch in which to perform your work
1. update the reverse-domain ID
1. add at least one platform to your project (iOS or Android)
1. initialize the Ionic Pro Client
1. add the Ionic Pro Cordova Plugin
1. build your application for your device
1. install the application on your device
1. squash your committed changes, merge your branch, and push to Ionic Pro
1. try the Ionic Pro deploy feature


## Creating a Feature Branch

When using Git, you should never do your work in the `master` branch. You should get in the habit of using a workflow similar to the following:

1. create a working "feature" branch
1. commit changes early and often
1. use a combination of `git fetch origin master` and `git rebase -i origin/master` to bring your code up to date with changes made by other developers and squash changes into a single commit with a meaningful message
1. submit your changes for review via a "pull request"
1. merge the changes into master after review

A similar (though simplified) workflow will be used throughout this course.

Start by creating a new branch via `git checkout -b feature/integrateIonicPro`

## Update the Reverse-Domain ID

The reverse domain ID is used as the Bundle ID or iOS and the Package Name for Android. It should be something unique. For personal applications, I suggest using `com.yourname.appname`.


1. open the `config.xml` file
1. change the `id` property of the `widget` node
1. `git commit -am "feat(ionic-pro): integrate ionic pro"`

```xml
<widget id="com.kensodemann.ionicweather"
        version="0.0.1"
        xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/widgets"
        xmlns:cdv="http://cordova.apache.org/ns/1.0">
```

## Add a Platform (or Two)

Add at least the platform matching the device you will use for this course. If you do not want to use an actual device, you can also use a simulator.

1. run at least one of the following
    1. `ionic cordova platform add ios`
    1. `ionic cordova platform add android`
1. `git add resources/*`
1. `git commit -am "Added platforms"`

**Note:** If you have Xcode 10, you may need to take <a href="https://github.com/apache/cordova-ios/issues/407" target="_blank">this cordova-ios issue</a> into account.

## Initialize Ionic Pro

The following steps are a summary of the steps found in the Ionic Pro documentation's <a href="https://ionicframework.com/docs/pro/deploy/setup/#pro-client-setup" target="_blank">Pro Client Setup</a>.

1. edit `app.module.ts`
1. import `Injectable`, `Injector` from `@angular/core`
1. import `Pro` from `@ionic/pro`
1. call `Pro.init()` passing your APP_ID from Ionic Pro and configuration object with a version
1. set up a custom error handler for monitoring
1. `git commit -am "WIP - init Ionic Pro"`

When you are done, your `app.module.ts` file should look something like this:

```TypeScript
import { ErrorHandler, Injectable, Injector, NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { IonicApp, IonicModule, IonicErrorHandler } from 'ionic-angular';
import { MyApp } from './app.component';

import { Pro } from '@ionic/pro';

import { AboutPage } from '../pages/about/about';
import { ContactPage } from '../pages/contact/contact';
import { HomePage } from '../pages/home/home';
import { TabsPage } from '../pages/tabs/tabs';

import { StatusBar } from '@ionic-native/status-bar';
import { SplashScreen } from '@ionic-native/splash-screen';

Pro.init('1234abcd', {
  appVersion: '0.0.1'
});

@Injectable()
export class MyErrorHandler implements ErrorHandler {
  ionicErrorHandler: IonicErrorHandler;

  constructor(injector: Injector) {
    try {
      this.ionicErrorHandler = injector.get(IonicErrorHandler);
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  }

  handleError(err: any): void {
    Pro.monitoring.handleNewError(err);
    this.ionicErrorHandler && this.ionicErrorHandler.handleError(err);
  }
}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyApp, AboutPage, ContactPage, HomePage, TabsPage],
  imports: [BrowserModule, IonicModule.forRoot(MyApp)],
  bootstrap: [IonicApp],
  entryComponents: [MyApp, AboutPage, ContactPage, HomePage, TabsPage],
  providers: [
    StatusBar,
    SplashScreen,
    IonicErrorHandler,
    { provide: ErrorHandler, useClass: MyErrorHandler }
  ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Add the Ionic Pro Cordova Plugin

You are now ready to install the Ionic Pro Cordova plugin. Use a command like the following. Make sure you use your application's ID in place of `YOUR_APP_ID`.

You can also generate this command by clicking `SET UP DEPLOY` on the channels page for your application on the Ionic Pro dashboard.

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ionic --save \
--variable APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID" \
--variable CHANNEL_NAME="Master" \
--variable UPDATE_METHOD="auto"
```

When you are done, you should see markup similar to the following in your `config.xml` file:


```xml
    <plugin name="cordova-plugin-ionic" spec="5.1.3">
        <variable name="APP_ID" value="1234abcd" />
        <variable name="CHANNEL_NAME" value="Master" />
        <variable name="UPDATE_METHOD" value="auto" />
        <variable name="WARN_DEBUG" value="true" />
        <variable name="UPDATE_API" value="https://api.ionicjs.com" />
        <variable name="MAX_STORE" value="2" />
        <variable name="MIN_BACKGROUND_DURATION" value="30" />
    </plugin>
```

You should also see markup similar to the following in your `package.json` file

```JSON
  "cordova": {
    "plugins": {
      "cordova-plugin-whitelist": {},
      "cordova-plugin-statusbar": {},
      "cordova-plugin-device": {},
      "cordova-plugin-splashscreen": {},
      "cordova-plugin-ionic-webview": {},
      "cordova-plugin-ionic-keyboard": {},
      "cordova-plugin-ionic": {
        "APP_ID": "024c2e54",
        "CHANNEL_NAME": "Master",
        "UPDATE_METHOD": "auto",
        "WARN_DEBUG": "true",
        "UPDATE_API": "https://api.ionicjs.com",
        "MAX_STORE": "2",
        "MIN_BACKGROUND_DURATION": "30"
      }
    },
```

These parameters can be updated later if need be. For example, you may want to use a different update method.

Be sure to commit your changes: `git commit -am "WIP - add the ionic pro plugin"`

## Build the Application for Your Device

Run at least one of the following commands:

- `ionic cordova build android`
- `ionic cordova build ios`

The iOS build may fail in the packaging step, but that is OK. 

## Install the Application on Your Device

### iOS 

**Note:** you may need to perform some security related configuration on your device and you will need to have some form of an Apple developer account be it via your organization or a personal account (which can be free or paid)

1. open the project in Xcode: `open platforms/ios/ionic-weather.xcworkspace`
1. click on `ionic-weather` in the project tree
1. choose either your personal team or your organization's team
1. connect your phone
1. select your phone from the device drop-down
1. press the run button

**Note:** it is also possible to use `ionic cordova run ios` but I find that Xcode works better and more consistently.

### Android 

**Note:** you will need to put your device in "Developer Mode" if it is not already

1. connect your device
1. `adb devices` - make sure your device is listed
1. `ioinc cordova run android` - this will build your application and run it on your attached Android device

**Note:** it is also possible to use Android Studio to build and run the application

## Squash (Optional) and Merge (Required)

During the development of this feature, I suggested that you commit your changes early and often. It is now time to squash those intermediate commits into a single commit for this feature and merge that commit into master.

A typical workflow looks like the following (this assumes that you set up an origin remote)

1. `git fetch origin master` - make sure we have all changes from other devs
1. `git rebase -i origin/master` - replay all of our changes on top of the latest changes in `origin/master` 

**NOTE:** if you don't have an `origin` remote, those steps are just `git rebase -i master`

At this point, you will be presented with a screen such as the following (note that you will be in whatever the default editor is currently set to, which is generally `vi`):

```
pick e011996 feat(ionic-pro): integrate ionic pro
pick 31cac5b WIP - add platforms
pick 639cf97 WIP - init Ionic Pro
pick ffad2b9 WIP - add the ionic pro plugin

# Rebase 4b04e62..ffad2b9 onto 4b04e62 (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
```

You have a lot of flexibility. What you want to do most of the time is `pick` the first commit, and `fixup` all of the others. So, edit this to look like such:

```
pick e011996 feat(ionic-pro): integrate ionic pro
f 31cac5b WIP - add platforms
f 639cf97 WIP - init Ionic Pro
f ffad2b9 WIP - add the ionic pro plugin

# Rebase 4b04e62..ffad2b9 onto 4b04e62 (4 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick <commit> = use commit
# r, reword <commit> = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit <commit> = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash <commit> = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup <commit> = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec <command> = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop <commit> = remove commit
# l, label <label> = label current HEAD with a name
# t, reset <label> = reset HEAD to a label
# m, merge [-C <commit> | -c <commit>] <label> [# <oneline>]
# .       create a merge commit using the original merge commit's
# .       message (or the oneline, if no original merge commit was
# .       specified). Use -c <commit> to reword the commit message.
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
```

Exit `vi` while writing the file (I use `<esc>:x` but there are multiple ways to do this), and git will execute the rebase script, reapplying your changes on top of any other changes and squashing it down to a single commit

You are now ready to push this branch to `origin` and submit it for peer review via a "pull request".

For the purpose of this training, we will just merge into master and push:

1. `git checkout master`
1. `git merge feature/integrateIonicPro`
1. `get push`
1. `git branch -d feature/integrateIonicPro`

## Try Ionic Pro Deploy

Currently, the about page does not show anything. Use that fact to test your deploy by modifying the `about.html` file as such:

```html
<ion-header>
  <ion-navbar>
    <ion-title>
      About
    </ion-title>
  </ion-navbar>
</ion-header>

<ion-content padding>
  <div>
    This is a starter application, so I cannot really tell you much.
  </div>
</ion-content>
```

1. close the application running on your device (be sure to close it, not just background it)
1. make the above change
1. `git commit -am "test(ionic-pro): update the about page"`
1. `git push`
1. `git push ionic master`
1. once the build finishes, verify that the master channel has been updated to the latest build
1. open the app, and verify your change is there

**Note:** we just made a change on `master` and pushed it rather than using a branch and merge strategy. Never do this in production. You _will_ cause issues in a multi-developer project if you do.
