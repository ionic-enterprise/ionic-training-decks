# Training: Identity Vault / Ionic / Angular / Capacitor

This training demonstrates how to integrate Identity Vault within an Ionic Framework application that has been written using Angular and Capacitor. In the course of this training you will:

- Examine common token storing schemes
- Integrate Identity Vault to securely store a token
- Provide browser based storage for non-native use scenarios
- Lock the token behind biometrics or a PIN
- Provide a custom PIN dialog

It is assumed that before taking this training you have a general understanding of how to build a hybrid mobile application using the Ionic Framework with Angular and either Cordova or Capacitor. This training uses Capacitor, but a deep understanding of Capacitor itself is not required.
