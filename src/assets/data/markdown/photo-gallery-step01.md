# Lab: Generate the Application

In this lab, you will:

* generate an Ionic application
* build and run the generated application

## `ionic start`

The first step is to create the application. To do this, use the `ionic start` command.

1. In a command prompt, change directory to the working folder
1. Run the following command: `ionic start photo-gallery blank --type=angular`

This process will run for a while. It will generate the application from a starter template, install the required libraries via NPM, initialize the local git repository for the application, and perform the initial git commit.

```bash
✔ Preparing directory ./photo-gallery - done!
✔ Downloading and extracting blank starter - done!

Installing dependencies may take several minutes.

```

Note the final message in the output. This is asking if you would like to connect your application to Appflow. You can answer **n** (No) for now.

## Building and Running

Let's just make sure the application builds and runs:

1. `cd photo-gallery`
1. `ionic serve`

The application should run in the default browser.

## Conclusion

In this lab, we learned how to generate a simple starter application and how to run the application in the browser.
