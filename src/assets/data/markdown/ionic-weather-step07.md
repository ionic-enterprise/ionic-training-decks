# Lab: Getting Data

Your app looks nice, but it does not display real data. Let's fix that.

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Create a new service using the Ionic CLI
* Use Angular's `HttpClient` service to get data from an API
* Transform the data for consumption by your application


## Getting Started

* Go to <a href="https://openweathermap.org/" target="_blank">OpenWeatherMap.org</a> and sign up for a free account so you can have an API key (if you do not want to do this, you can use the API key I generated for this class, but I _will_ be removing it after the class is over)
* Use the Ionic CLI to generate a new provider called `weather` (Hint: the Ionic CLI has a `--help` option that can be used at several levels)
* Use git to verify the files were created and that your new service is provided in `app.module.ts`
* Be sure to add the newly generated file to your commit
* Make your initial commit for this feature

The API key to use if you do not want to generate your own is currently: `db046b8bbe642b799cb40fa4f7529a12`

## Initial Setup

The generated `weather` service (or "provider") gives you a lot of what you need to get started, but let's clean that up a little.

1. Remove the comment near the top of the file
1. Modify the `HttpClient` to be `private` rather than `public` (it is initially public to avoid a linting error until you actually use it)
1. Modify the constructor to have an empty body

### Basic Configuration

Let's add some basic configuration data. Have a look at the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">Open Weather Map API</a> documentation. You will see that the various endpoints:

* All start with: `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5`
* Can take several formats for location (we will use latitude/longitude)
* All take an `appid` parameter with the API key (this is less obvious)

The first version of the app will use a hard coded location. I am using Madison, WI, USA because that is where the Ionic HQ is located, but you should use something closer to your home. You can use a web-site such as <a href="https://www.latlong.net/" target="_blank">LatLong.net</a> to find the coordinates of your city. 

Add your key, the base URL, and your coordinates as private data in the service. My private data looks like this:

```TypeScript
  private appId = 'db046b8bbe642b799cb40fa4f7529a12';
  private baseUrl = 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5';

  private latitude = 43.073051;
  private longitude = -89.401230;
```

## Getting the Data

Angular's <a href="https://angular.io/api/common/http/HttpClient" target="_blank">HttpClient</a> service is very flexible and has several options for working with RESTful data. We will not go into full details, as that could be a full course on its own. For the purposes of this course, we will only be using GET verb to retrieve data. 

The basic format for such a call is: `get(url: string): Observable<any>`. In our case, the url can be built as such: 

```TypeScript
${this.baseUrl}/foo?lat=${this.latitude}&lon=${this.longitude}&appid=${this.appId}
```

So a basic method that returns this data looks like this:

```TypeScript
  current(): Observable<any> {
    return this.http.get(
      `${this.baseUrl}/weather?lat=${this.latitude}&lon=${
        this.longitude
      }&appid=${this.appId}`);
  }
```

Add that method to your `weather` service to get the current weather. Then add two additional methods: one for forecasts and one for the UV index. Refer to the API docs for the exact endpoint to use.

**Hint:** You'll need to import `Observable` from `rxjs` at the top of your file.

## Transforming the Data

Now we can retrieve our data, but we need to transform it into a format that our application can use.

### Current Weather

#### Transforming the Result Object

Review the <a href="https://openweathermap.org/current#current_JSON" target="_blank">API docs</a> and have a look at our `Weather` model. We need grab the following data:

* **temperature** - Available as part of `main.temp`
* **condition** - This is the `weather.id`, but because `weather` is an array of objects, we will use the `id` from the first object in the array (`weather[0].id`) 
* **date** - This is available from `dt`; note that the date is Unix UTC

**Challenge**: Add a private method to your service called `unpackWeather` that has the following signature: `private unpackWeather(res: any): Weather`. Unpack `res` (the **res**ult of the HTTP call) as described above and then return it in a `Weather` object.

Try to complete this challenge without looking at the completed code.

#### Applying the Transform

Observables in rxjs can be piped through a whole host of operators. One of the most useful is `map` which is used to map one object to another. The basic syntax is: `this.http.get(url).pipe(map(res: any) => someTransform(res));`

**Challenge:** apply the transform to your `current()` method:

* change the return type to `Observable<Weather>`
* append the `pipe` from above to the `get()` call as such: `.pipe.map((res: any) => this.unpackWeather(res));`

**Hint:** You will need to import some stuff from a couple of different ES6 modules at the top of your file. The `map` function is in the `rxjs/operators` module.

## Forecast

Transforming the forecast data is more complex. We need to go through the `list` and create an array of forecasts for each individual day. I am going to give you the code for that. Try walking through it as you copy it in to understand how it is working.

```TypeScript
  private unpackForecast(res: any): Forecast {
    let currentDay: Array<Weather>;
    let prevDate: number;
    const forecast: Forecast = [];

    res.list.forEach(item => {
      const w = this.unpackWeather(item);
      if (w.date.getDate() !== prevDate) {
        prevDate = w.date.getDate();
        currentDay = [];
        forecast.push(currentDay);
      }
      currentDay.push(w);
    });

    return forecast;
  }
```

**Challenge:** Now that you have the transform, apply it in your `forecast()` method. Remember that you should change the return type - specifically, the type specified for the `Observable<any>`.

## UV Index

Here is the model we have for the UV index:

```TypeScript
export interface UVIndex {
  value: number,
  riskLevel: number
}
```

* **value** - Use the `value` from the HTTP result
* **riskLevel** - This level should be calculated by us based on the `value`:
   * 0 - a `value` < 3
   * 1 - a `value` >= 3 and < 6
   * 2 - a `value` >= 6 and < 8
   * 3 - a `value` >= 8 and < 11 
   * 4 - a `value` >= 11

**Challenge:** Write a private `unpackUVIndex(res: any): UVIndex` method that unpacks the HTTP result as specified. You will need to write up some code to calculate the `riskLevel` as part of the method. When that is finished, apply the `map` transform as you did with the `forecast()` method.

## Finish the Feature

Compare your code to the completed code that I've included. It does not have to be identical, but it should be functionally equivalent. We have not tested any of this yet, which is scary and a really good argument for unit tests. Nonetheless, let's make sure everything has been committed.
