# Training: PWA / Ionic / Angular

This set of labs take the Ionic Weather application and deploys it as a PWA. Minor modifications are required in order to run the application as a PWA. Most of this lab is actually lecture material. If you design and build your appication appropriately, then there is very little effort required in order to create a PWA from your application. In these labs you will learn:

- How to use Firebase Hosting to host your app
- How to add the default service worker and app manifest
- How to use Lighthouse to score your app
